I collaborated with over 100 people to classify tweets related to natural disasters. This experience not only helped me develop my technical skills but also instilled in me a deep appreciation for the potential of machine learning in addressing real-world challenges. Therefore, I developed a TF-IDF binary classifier in Python which concludes whether or not a given tweet is related to a natural disaster with a 92% accuracy.
