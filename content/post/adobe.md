ResourceMe is an app which creates a communication channel between homeless shelters(receivers) and donors(givers). It achieves this by having a streamlined and straightforward interface, gamification mechanics which engage the users through the use of AI, and geolocation algorithms for a clearer look at where the receiverâ€™s main area of help is. The app is made in Angular 16, and uses a Firestore database( https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ ), the map API is taken from leaflet ( https://leafletjs.com/ ), the OpenAI API was used for calculating the generosity score of the givers, and, in the end, through Twilio we see whether or not the giver actually did the donation( https://www.twilio.com/en-us/messaging ).
