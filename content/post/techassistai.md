## [TechAssistAI](https://techassistai.bytepods.com)

Tech is getting more accesible as time goes on, but it remains a mystery to many people how it can be fixed if it breaks up at some point. This is the problem I aimed to solve when creating TechAssistAI.

It is a tool which helps people easily troubleshoot and fix their devices using the Artificial Intelligence developed by OpenAI. It has an easy to use and understand UI, which can be used by anyone.

For now, it remains a personal project, but it could become something more than this, as it would be loved by enterprises. Companies have hoards of employees that work in the it deparment, thus, their costs could be decreased if they used TechAssistAI instead of hiring qualified people.

It is a project I started because I wanted to mess around with OpenAI, but after realising the potential it could reach, I am keen on developing it into a real business.
